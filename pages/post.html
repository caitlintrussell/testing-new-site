  <p class='text-area'>Holy cow, what a whirlwind it's been already. I've been on-campus at Fullstack, loving every moment for three weeks. It's so hard to believe how far I've come in these past few weeks. On Tuesday of week two, I felt as though I should just quit because I was not smart enough to understand Express. No longer! But I suppose, you GET out what you PUT in. ;) Here's a little recap.</p>
  <p class='orange-text'>Foundations</p>
	<p class='text-area'>
    Foundations, the four week primer to the on-campus immersive, was pretty chill for me. I obsessively studied most of the concepts we covered in foundations while preparing for my admissions test to Fullstack. But of course, my knowledge was limited, and I left foundations with a very confident handle on callback functions, recursion, <em>this</em>, and prototypal inheritance. Outside of the foundations curriculum, I worked on brushing up on my design knowledge, learning about all the new and great options with CSS3. WOW. CSS has sure changed a lot since I learned it in 2006. I revamped my domain (hi!), souped up the <a href="https://caitlintrussell.github.io/guessingGame/" target="_blank">guessing game</a> I made in foundations, and slept so so much.

  <p class='orange-text'>Week One</p>
	<p class='text-area'>
    The first week was so nerve-wracking, being confronted with imposter-syndrome everywhere I turned. We learned basic CS principles and data structures, and built Javascript dupes of linked lists, binary search trees, queues, etc. We pair-program every single day and have a new partner for every workshop. I've grown to love it, but in the beginning, I felt the same anxiety as when starting a new job, everyday. One spends almost as much time trying to figure out the other's working style as one does trying to solve the problems. I've learned an amazing new kind of patience and dropped all previous anxiety about working with strangers. Oh, and vanilla JS dom traversal, too! Looks like I'll be refactoring this site very soon...Catch ya later, JQuery!
  </p>
  <p class='orange-text'>Week Two</p>
	<p class='text-area'>
    NODE. Big week. We rebuilt the basic functionalities of Node. We learned http requests with Express. Learned basic SQL with Sequelite3, then moved on to Postgres. Express kicked my ass for three straight days, then something clicked. I got it. All that knowledge finally soaked in and I was finally handling requests and errors like a champ (perhaps an exaggeration...).

  <p class='orange-text'>Week Three</p>
	<p class='text-area'>
    Though we dealt with basic asynchronicity in past week, we were enlightened to the real problems with callbacks and our new frenemy, PROMISES. We began the week with building a basic Wikipedia clone using this CRAZY node-based ORM called Sequelize. While I, for one, was very happy to not work with raw SQL queries anymore, Sequelize was a completely different type of beast to tame. After that, we took an even deeper dive into the concept of Promises, working to replicate their functionality with our own classes. Very enlightening, very challenging. Thank you so much, ECMA, for fully integrating promises into ES6. I'm so grateful. We have our first timed checkpoint on Express and Sequelize tomorrow morning, as a benchmark test for everything we've learned thus far. I'm a little nervous, but I think I'll be ready with a couple more hours of studying docs. Wish me luck..Again!

    Well, hello there! Y'all don't know me, but I've been going through this terrifying and amazing experience of changing my career, my life, everything. The story is pretty cliché, so I won't go too deep into it, but I'm about to begin attending Fullstack Academy, a software engineering bootcamp in Chicago, IL. Here is how I got here.
  </p>

    I attended university at SAIC and graduated in '14 after completing their rigorous fashion design program. My time at school was horrible and wonderful, with lots of sleepless nights. After a move to New Orleans, some time working at the amazing <a href="http://tchoupindustries.com" target="_blank">Tchoup Industries</a>, I returned to Chicago (mostly for the hot dogs, art museums and public transportation). Back in Chicago, I worked for a marketing/branding agency as their lead product designer, designing soft-goods and managing a production team to create objects for media influencers.

    It was August '17 when I entered the wonderful world of programming and met my best friend/mortal enemy, Javascript. Over the years, I've helped out friends and family with their web design projects, jumbling together some HTML, CSS and PHP to get the job done. I always enjoyed it, but I also saw it <em>technical</em> work, which I could not do professionally because I am a <em>creative</em> person. How naïve! I did most of Codecademy front-end track, loads of CodeWars and generally dreaded going to work because I didn't want to stop watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q"  target="_blank">Fun Fun Function</a>. My brain changed, JS was all I could think of. In December, Fullstack Academy launched the Grace Hopper Track, and I jumped at the chance to ditch my graph rulers and Juki 8700 for my keyboard and ITerm2. It starts soon, wish me luck.
